    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The workforce is the most vital part of our society. It’s also vital to each and every one of the lives within. Similar to clockwork, our society’s members fit together and work in unison. Society allows us to accomplish much more than we ever could on their own. Through work, an individual can obtain food, shelter, healthcare, and all the other necessities of modern life. Jobs are the most essential part of modern life. So, when something begins to change/revolutionize the workforce, and society in turn, it becomes glaringly important. Not only is it important to society, but to each and every one of the lives within. That important something is AI. AI’s impact on the workforce is important and will be substantial. AI’s grasp on society will differ across regions and industries. In some cases, the impact will be positive, and in other cases, it will be negative. Regardless, AI will be the reason for society’s inevitable advance. It’s only a matter of when. Before we discuss the current and future effects of AI on society, a solid understanding of AI is required.</p>
    <h2 id="6kc">6 Key Capabilities</h2>
    <p>Although with time, the possibilities of AI will be endless, here are 6 of the current, key capabilities of AI. First, there’s personalization profiling systems.</p>
    <h1 id="pps">Personalization Profiling Systems</h1>
    <p>These systems use AI to understand a person as a unique individual, profiling them and collecting data. Individuals are profiled based on their actions and choices. In today’s society, examples of these systems being implemented can be seen in applications like Spotify, Netflix, and Amazon. Something all of us use. These companies use personalization profiling systems to cater to their users. Another real-life example of profiling systems can be seen being implemented by banks. Also, something that we all use. Profiling systems are particularly used when banks decide whether or not to give an individual a loan. AI implemented by banks take many factors into account when deciding if an individual qualifies for a loan. Credit, income, debt-to-income ratio, and collateral are among the things AI programs consider.</p>
    <h1 id="ptf">Predicting the Future</h1>
    <p>The next capability of AI, and one of the most surprising, is predicting the future. This is done through prediction systems. A prediction system is when an AI draws patterns out of historical/past data and uses the patterns to make predictions. An example of prediction systems being used can be seen in the stock market. Individuals use the systems to predict stock and currency exchange prices. For investors, prediction systems give great advice on what stocks to put in a portfolio.</p>
    <h1 id="nl">Natural Language</h1>
    <p>The next capability is natural language. Obviously, computers don’t communicate the same way we humans do. Language is our unique way of communicating. Its full of ambiguities and contextual meanings. A conversation system is designed to understand human speech and reply in a natural language. These machines can also implement something called sentimental analysis, which can determine emotion through speech. In the world today, examples of AI’s using natural language capabilities are Siri and Google Assistant. Chatbots and automated call assistants are also examples.</p>
    <h1 id="praad">Pattern Recognition and Anomaly Detection</h1>
    <p>The next capability of AI is pattern recognition and anomaly detection. These systems use data to find patterns and determine if something is normal or an anomaly. AI can then use this data and act accordingly. Commonly, an AI will use its gathered patterns to predict something happening, similar to prediction systems. An example of pattern recognition can be seen in any online search bar that shows suggestions for half-typed words.</p>
    <h1 id="oi">Object Identification</h1>
    <p>The fifth capability of AI is object identification. Object identification systems use machine learning to recognize things in the world. The system can analyze images, video, audio, and other types of media. “This capability is basically an AI’s vision”(Ching). This capability is being used in today’s world a lot. Self-driving cars, security detection systems, and facial recognition are all examples of object Identification.</p>
    <h1 id="ga">Goal Achievement</h1>
    <p>Lastly, the final capability of AI is Goal achievement. These systems use machine learning to learn through action and experience. Through algorithms, a machine can be programmed with a specific task in mind. In other words, it uses accomplishments and failures to figure out problems and solve them, while getting smarter and smarter as it goes. Popular implementations of AI’s using Goal Achievement can be seen in online games. Computer controlled opponents have been able to set high scores across many games, defeat chess grandmasters, and even defeat the world’s best players of popular game, Dota.</p>
    <h1 id="tiat">Tying it All Together</h1>
    <p>Now realizing the key capabilities of AI, its easy to see how these capabilities can form AI capable of joining the workforce. For example, an AI with goal achievement, natural language, and pattern recognition can easily handle hotlines or retail order support. And that’s just one of the possibilities. Consider the combination of AI and robotics, and you have machinery capable of many physical jobs currently held by individuals. Soon enough, A.I will be able to automate jobs left and right. One field that utilizes AI a lot is healthcare. Here are some of the implementations seen in within the field.</p>

    <h2 id="aih">AI in Healthcare</h2>
    <p>With a form of machine learning called precision medicine, healthcare professionals use algorithms to make accurate diagnoses. The algorithm uses information collected from previous patients to diagnose the problem and determine successful treatment options. Precision medicine is a type of personalization profiling. Another AI implementation found in healthcare is where AI use algorithms to identify cancerous lesions in radiology pictures. This algorithm definitely uses object identification, one of the key capabilities mentioned earlier. Some other implementations of AI include algorithms for transcribing patient doctor interactions, robotic tools used by doctors in surgery, and algorithms used for repetitive tasks within hospitals. Inherently apparent, AI is positively impacting the medical industry. But how is it impacting others?</p>
    
    <h2 id="aioon">AI Impact on Other Industries</h2>
    <p>According to Niall McCarthy, Globally, within all manufacturing industries, there are 113 installed industrial robots per 10,000 employees.  In the U.S, this ratio rises to 228 robots per 10,000 employees. Considering the U.S. has 14,550,000 manufacturing workers, the number of robot counterparts is more than many imagine. When you crunch the numbers, it is revealed that there are 309,915 installed robots within U.S. manufacturing industries. But what does this mean? Well, each additional robot added in manufacturing replaces, on average, about 3.3 workers (Dizikies). And since there are 309,915 robots, industrial workers have lost 1,022,719 opportunities for jobs or their own jobs. However, the amount of replaced workers drastically changes depending on the industry. According to Acemoglu and Restrepo, “Within the United States., four manufacturing industries account for 70 percent of robots: automakers (38 percent of robots in use), electronics (15 percent), the plastics and chemical industry (10 percent), and metals manufacturers (7 percent)” (McCarthy). But even with about a million jobs being replaced by robots, there is still a lot of good taking place. We saw how positively AI impacted the medical industry. For companies implementing AI and robots, they experience increased productivity and revenue. Workers are able to find specialization jobs that AI and industrial robots cannot do. These jobs are ones that emphasize importance on creativity, problem solving, and quantitative skills.</p>
    <p>As time goes on, the workforce as we know it will become more and more automated. “The consensus among many experts is that a number of professions will be totally automated in the next five to ten years” (Thomas). The Forbes technology council, a group of senior-level tech executives, names 13 professions that are at risk of being automated. Specifically, insurance underwriting, warehouse and manufacturing jobs, customer service, research and data entry, long haul trucking or any other jobs that can be “learned” by AI. In the next 5 years, with entire professions being automated, it is expected that AI will replace 85 million jobs worldwide. But even though these numbers seem shocking and severe to you, rest easy, because a report by the World Economic Forum, says AI will create 97 million jobs.  This is because implementing and maintaining technology takes work. So even though AI is taking jobs away, it is also creating new jobs, and then some. But what about jobs that aren’t at risk of being automated? Jobs that can’t be automated, are predicted to have high growth. Specifically, higher education jobs. Jobs that require a college education to acquire. “One source claim that high-paying jobs requiring a bachelor’s degree or above will face only 29% job change due to automation” (Jain). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, examples of these jobs are accountants, forensic scientists, geological technicians, technical writers, MRI operators, dietitians, financial specialists, web developers, loan officers, medical secretaries, and customer service representatives.</p>
    <h2 id="sp">Some Problems and Solutions</h2>
    <p>The first issue that happens with AI is income disparity. In a scenario where AI is numerous, the wealth made through AI won’t be distributed equally. This makes sense because companies and corporations investing in AI are the ones that will profit from increased productivity and the avoidance of paying wages. The employees are the ones who get the short end of the stick. However, Laura Tyson brings forth a solution. She says that “a higher minimum wage, accompanied by a negative income tax , can balance the wage inequality caused by increased automation and subsequent job loss” (Jain). Another one of the big downsides to AI is that it, in certain industries, people will lose jobs. Since job loss will take place in industries relying on standard routines, individuals will have to acquire new, in demand skills. To encourage this adaptation, one thing policymakers could do is restructure school curricula so that it pertains to these in demand skills. Curricula needs to be centered around STEM-related subjects and digital skills along with statistics and computer coding.  These are the skills that will be in high demand. Looking at the current educational data within the U.S, a change in curricula is dire. Especially when considering the threat of AI displacing poorly educated workers. Out of 79 countries, the U.S. ranks 36th in Math proficiency, and places 13th in reading proficiency. Clearly the country is already behind in quality education. Perhaps the threat of AI will push the country in a better direction. Another thing that could be done is to have companies give out training as a benefit to their displaced employees. Of course, this will only work if the company is incentivized. A tax credit  would be perfect for this. Although the corporations and companies would be losing money training their employees, they would be paying less taxes, therefore making the money, or at least some of it, back. The employees, being the primary beneficiaries, would receive training so they could continue working and provide for themselves.</p>
    <h2 id="a">Amazon</h2>
    <p>Although this company isn’t receiving tax credits, or any compensation for that matter, they are implementing a perfect example of worker training. Out of the kindness of their heart, Amazon are training their workers. Since amazon expects to become more and more automated as time goes on, they are willing to spend 700 million dollars to train 100,000 employees in a program called “Upskilling 2025”. The program will teach workers technical skills that they can apply while working for amazon or working somewhere else entirely. </p>
    <h2 id="c">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>To conclude, the workforce, and the people that form it, are the “lifeblood” of society. AI will change our society and in turn, the world and all our lives. Sure, AI  may destroy millions of jobs, but with a few implementations like higher minimum wage, tax credits, and companies providing training to employees, the workforce will persevere. And when it does, society will have ascended. The capabilities of AI are endless. The life-saving benefits AI brings to the medical field are just one example of the positives AI can bring. AI will change the world for the better.</p>
